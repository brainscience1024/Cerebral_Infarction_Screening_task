# Machine Learning-Based Feature Selection and Classification for Cerebral Infarction Screening: An Experimental Study  

## Overview  

This repository accompanies the study titled **"Machine learning-based feature selection and classification for cerebral infarction screening: an experimental study."**  
The project explores the use of machine learning methods to select critical features and classify cerebral infarction, aiming to improve early screening accuracy.  

## Repository Contents  

- **Raw Data**: The dataset used in the study, stored in the `data` directory.  
- **Code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification model implementation, located in the `code` directory.  

## Usage  

1. Access the `data` directory for the raw dataset.  
2. Follow the scripts in the `code` directory to preprocess the data and apply the classification models.

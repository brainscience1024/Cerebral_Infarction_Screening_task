# Cerebral Infarction Screening Project

## Overview

This project is dedicated to the screening of cerebral infarction. The objective is to develop and validate methods for early detection and classification of cerebral infarction through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### `code`

This directory contains the source code for the project. It includes scripts for data processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

### `data`

This directory holds the datasets used for training and testing the models. It includes raw data files and any preprocessed data required for analysis.

## Usage

To get started with the project:

1. Explore the `code` directory for implementation details and instructions on how to run the scripts.
2. Review the `data` directory for information on the available datasets and their formats.

For detailed documentation and instructions, please refer to the specific files within each directory.
